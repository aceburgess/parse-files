### Parsing Files and outputting them in a specific way
* Output 1: Sorted by Gender (females first and then sorted last name)
* Output 2: Sorted by birthdate ascending (and then last name)
* Output 3: Sorted by Last Name descending

### Running the program
Run the file `runner.rb` in terminal.

To run type `ruby runner.rb`

The terminal interface will ask for an input of relative filenames.
To use the test files included type the following:

`ruby-code-test-files/space_delimited.txt ruby-code-test-files/comma_delimited.txt ruby-code-test-files/pipe_delimited.txt`

or type your own files with a similar formatting to the comma, pipe, or space delimited files.

The terminal interface will then ask you for an output filename.
The default is `output.txt`. So if you just hit enter and leave it blank `output.txt` will be the outputted files name.

The program will let you know of a `success` or `failure`.
